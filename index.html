<h1 class="u-space-tm">Hello!</h1>
<p class="u-space-bs">
I’m Sheriff Jolaoso,
</p>
<p>
An experience designer, I aim to develop experiences that are intuitive, delightful, and most importantly
help people solve problems. I work in the digital space primarily, but along with product design practices, I am a practitioner of service design methodologies to support all levels of experience design. I aspire for opportunities that allow me to positively affect people and collaborate with colleagues in an intelligent, empathethic way.

<h1>Work</h1>

<h1>About myself</h1>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7">
        <p>I'm a guy who makes an effort to be deliberate, considerate, and thorough with my work and life. With those three adjectives in the mix comes clarity, depth, and thoughtfulness, may it be in something I'm experiencing myself or something I am designing. I understand the value of various viewpoints being integral for a valuable output to arise to accommodate outcomes for the appropriate audiences.</p>

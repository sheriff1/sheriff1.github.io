-- PROBLEM --
- PF tools required me to introduce context on a too frequent basis
I wanted more context included in my personal finance tools, such as work travel not actually counting towards what I budget for and generic expenses paid by check without being alerted of unusual spending even though I'm paying rent for my roommates and myself.

A similar lack of context occurs with unvested funds in accounts. The PF tools may not know the vesting schedule of certain accounts, so the reflection of my net worth becomes a little inaccurate.


- I couldn't forecast variably 
Many PF tools didn't help in understanding the dynamic future. 
Potential increases in income & potential large debts help me get a sense of if I can spend money now or later.
I didn't want to solely use spreadsheets to perform these variable calculations, especially when all these PF tools are at my disposal and do great at aggregating my information.


-- SOLUTION --
- Moneywise
The Moneywise app allows me to see what my current account standing is and more accurately forecast what my finances will look like weeks and months into the future.


- Moneywise features

* View of my expenses and incomes for the week and the month, as well as the ability to see expenses and incomes for a given time period [image - 4 sections]
* Ability to add recurring expenses/incomes to have an approximation of how much I should expect to have in my respective accounts [image - expenses]
* Ability to add 1-time expenses/incomes to understand how things like travel may adjust my overall financial standing [image - expenses]


- Result

I feel like I understand my money flow a lot better. With Moneywise and personal finance advice, I've been able to strategically plan how to allot my funds, including making feasible long-term savings goals, understanding the optimal contributions I can make to my retirement funds, and identify an appropriate range for my disposable income. Fun fact: I can eat Chipotle slightly more often than I thought without worrying, heh.

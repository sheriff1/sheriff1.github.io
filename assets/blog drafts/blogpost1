As a designer, I aim to develop experiences that are intuitive and understandable.

- I believe intuitiveness and understandability have to be at tht forefront of any solution being assembled for a consumer. With those underlying values at the base of a solution, delight, aesthetics, and complexities can be infused, but not without the intent to make sure the solution makes sense to a user and does not come at a great cost to the user.

I aspire for opportunities that allow me to collaborate with intelligence, diligence, and empathy.

- I enjoy working with people that I can share a rhythm with; may the work be social or professional. I believe the rhythm is rooted in 
	- intelligence brought by all participants, in whatever area they can contribute in
	- diligence around the problems to be solved that can lead to people going beyond their current capacities
	- and empathy for who we're helping solve problems for and one another, which exposes and infuses the humanity in what we're working on.
It's exciting for me to find and collaborate with people in this lane because they make me care more about what I'm contributing. 

Five words to describe me: deliberate, introspective, humble, soulful, & chill.
- I'm low-key underwhelmed when people describe themselves solely professionally. I added this line because it is reflective of who I am and what I bring socially and professionally.

My most used emoji is üëçüèø .

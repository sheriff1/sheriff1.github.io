				<p>For my masters thesis, I conducted research in understanding the impact of an ambient display used as a personal task management reference tool.</p>
				<p class="u-space-bn">I hypothesized that TaskAmbient would be valuable to users based on its ability to aggregate information across multiple applications (email, calendar, checklists) and delineate information based on user-defined groupings. The visual metaphor being available on an ambient display also supported the hypothesis that information availability without having to navigate through various applications would be of value.</p>

		<h2 class="u-space-bm">Personal task management and intention retention</h2>
		<p>At the time I started my research, many tools were becoming popular in the space of  personal task management (Google Inbox, Check, Fantastical) and I was curious if these were cases of “just-another-app” and if there was an opportunity to revisit the underlying issues of personal task management.</p>
		<p>For my work, I keyed in on the underlying variable of intention retention. Intention retention is basically remembering that there is something to remember; the classic string-tied-to-the-finger.</p>
		<p>I found that aside from time and location-based notifications that personal task management tools can provide, there were very few personal task management tools that facilitate what can be described as a pseudo-serendipitous reminder to do something, so I began researching more into personal task management practices and what types of technology could be used to support such an idea.</p>

		<h2 class="u-space-bm">Survey of personal task management practices</h2>
		<p>To start my research, I wanted to validate whether intention retention was truly an issue people faced when using personal task management tools. In my survey, I also wanted to validate the value of aggregating personal task information across tools.</p>
		<p>Findings of note:</p>
		<div class="container-fluid">
			<div class="row vcenter u-space-bm u-space-vl">
				<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xl-4 u-space-bm">
					<div class="task-ambient-cards">
						<h3 class="big-num-header">51%</h3>
						<p class="u-pad-as match-height">51% of survey participants mentioned that they “always” or “most of the time” refer to their personal task management tools to remember what they need to do. This overhead of navigating just to realize there may or may not be something to tend to can be tedious.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xl-4 u-space-bm">
					<div class="task-ambient-cards">
						<h3 class="big-num-header">77%</h3>
						<p class="u-pad-as match-height ">77% of survey participants in the survey mentioned that aggregation of personal task information from the various tools they use could be valuable to them.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xl-4 u-space-bm">
					<div class="task-ambient-cards">
						<h3 class="big-num-header">6</h3>
						<p class="u-pad-as match-height ">Participants mentioned that there were on average 21 tasks across 6 areas of responsibility (for example school, work, family, practice, etc.) that they were managing in their memory.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>With the information gathered from the survey and through literature review, I felt confident proceeding in ideating on a tool that could:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>aggregate task information across tools, yet provide information about what source the task came from</li>
			<li>provide a path to on-demand intention retention without having to refer to multiple personal task management tools</li>
			<li>delineate personal task information across a user’s various areas of responsibility as opposed to an app-based delineation</li>
			<li>provide uniform metadata of the task that the original tools already provide, primarily task description, date, and urgency</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="u-space-bm">Ambient displays</h2>
		<p>After investigating various concepts that could cover the needs described above, I came to the conclusion that an ambient display could be used. An ambient display being a display someone has in their workplace, room, or household that isn’t meant to take a user’s primary attention. Instead, the display changes state and can be glanced at to capture information.</p>
		<p>I imagined that the ambient display could be used in the same way someone may use notes on the fridge.</p>
		<p>With using an ambient display and capitalizing on APIs and other technology, the note metaphor changes. Instead of a user having to write notes to themselves, the notes are automatically created and appended on the display.</p>

		<h2 class="u-space-bm">TaskAmbient</h2>
		<p> After research and ideation, I developed a tool named "TaskAmbient".</p>
		<p> In designing TaskAmbient, I provided users with the ability to login to TaskAmbient with their Google Calendar. During my survey, I attempted to identify a to-do list app that was commonly used for this work, but to no avail. With that being the case, I provided a to-do list app, created by my research group, to have a uniform way to source information for TaskAmbient.</p>
		<p>In TaskAmbient, users could defined up to 6 areas of responsibility and group their calendars and sub to-do lists in them. This provided users the ability to define areas as granular as they needed.</p>
		<p>TaskAmbient represented tasks as “chips” on the display:</p>
		<div class="container-fluid super-padding">
			<div class="row vcenter u-space-bm">
				<div class="col-xl-6 col-lg-6 u-space-bl"><img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/task-chip.png" alt="task chip example"/></div>
				<div class="col-xl-6 col-lg-6 single-border-left u-space-tm">
					<ul>
						<li>The color represents the area of responsibility and is accompanied by an abbreviation in the bottom-left corner</li>
						<li>An icon representing the original source (calendar or list) is in the bottom-right corner</li>
						<li>If the task was marked as high-priority", "!!!" will appear in the center</li>
						<li>When tapped or clicked, a description will appear on the display</li>
						<li>If the task is within a user-defined threshold, the chip will glow if the task is upcoming</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Users could filter and refresh the view, view past to-dos, and adjust settings such as adding and regrouping calendars and to-do lists and setting the time threshold for a chip to glow.
		</p>
		<p class="u-space-bl">In all, the key design tenets of TaskAmbient were:</p>

		<h2 class="u-space-bm">Longitudinal user study</h2>
		<p>To evaluate TaskAmbient, I conducted a study where I gave users iPads to use TaskAmbient in their homes and workplaces. They used TaskAmbient over the course of 6 weeks and I conducted weekly interviews with participants to learn about their usage. Participants were also given a brief survey twice a week to let us know how they recently used TaskAmbient.</p>
		<p>Overall, TaskAmbient was received well by participants, but needed further refinement for higher adoption. Integrations with other personal task management applications and the ability move chips on the display was the most-heard feedback received. It was also mentioned that a lower barrier of interaction was desired to know what the chip was about, so potentially providing a blurb on the chip itself would have been valuable.</p>
		<p>Although designed for use on an ambient display, since the app was web-based, users noted using TaskAmbient on their primary devices.</p>

		<h2 class="u-space-bm">In retrospect...</h2>
		<p>I learned a lot in the space of user research, software development, and UX design. Having to deal with hosting, creating and maintaining a databas, API usage, designing surveys and user studies, and designing user interfaces was great to experience end-to-end over the course of the project.</p>
		<p>If I were to conduct further research in this area, I would revisit my research on intention retention to get a better sense of how people were performing intention retention. Better understanding of the strengths and shortcomings of their current tools would have lent itself well to the design of TaskAmbient.</p> 
		<p>Also, I would look to incrementally design of TaskAmbient. In delivering a product, it is important to understand that you have satiated the initial needs of the user before designing on top of that. Although there was research backing the premise for a tool that could be a smart, adaptable forget-me-not, the design was driven on the form factor of the data. There may a have been a higher-level abstraction of this tool that could have served as an MVP, from which I could have learned more and continued development towards a more desirable tool.</p>

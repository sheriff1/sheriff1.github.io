						TaskAmbient
						<br/>
						For my masters thesis, I conducted research in understanding the impact of an ambient display used as a personal task management reference tool. The hypothesized values of using TaskAmbient were based on its visual format, ability to aggregate content across tools, its ability to delineate content based on user-defined context, and its ability to be instantly-on and readily available as opposed to having to navigate through individual applications to find task-based information.

					<li>During summer program at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, I conducted research in understanding two popular models of sensemaking in the data analytics community. Primarily evaluating the two models across four domains of study known to perform data analysis with large-scale data.

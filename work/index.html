						TaskAmbient
						<br/>
						For my masters thesis, I conducted research in understanding the impact of an ambient display used as a personal task management reference tool. The hypothesized values of using TaskAmbient were based on its visual format, ability to aggregate content across tools, its ability to delineate content based on user-defined context, and its ability to be instantly-on and readily available as opposed to having to navigate through individual applications to find task-based information.

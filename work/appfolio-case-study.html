				<p>The AppFolio Tenant Portal is where our customers’ tenants can log in to make rent payments and submit maintenance requests.</p>
				<p class="u-space-bn">AppFolio wanted to update their tenant portal to be modern and mobile-friendly in an effort to attract more customers and more tenants all-the-while maintaining an experience that was already working well for current tenants.</p>

			<p>At AppFolio, we primarily provide product and services to property management professionals who then provide services to tenants. There are few opportunities for AppFolio to have a direct effect on tenants though. Our primary avenue to affecting tenants is our online portal. </p>
			<p>In knowing this, we understood that our updates could be evaluated by anyone. We also noted there was an opportunity to have our ideas evaluated by people who had not used the portal before, which allowed us to garner feedback from perspectives that would compare the experience of using our portal to other experiences in which they had to make online payments or send requests to a vendor.</p>

			<p>We tested our design iterations through moderated and unmoderated tests on mobile and desktop devices. We primarily evaluated our payment process to assure that we were not introducing any design choices that would have adverse effects on the flow.</p>

				<h2 class="u-space-bm">Introducing extensibility to the portal design</h2>
				<p>With the redesign of the portal, we wanted to assure the design had familiar, reusable components that could be used going forward as we consider adding new features to the portal. We designed the portal to have responsive, modular, and scalable components.</p>
				<div id="inline-cards-img" class="u-space-vm"><img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/appfolio-case-study/cards.png" alt="t portal cards" style="width: 400px;"/></div>
				<h3>Responsive</h3>
				<p>Making the portal mobile-friendly was a priority, so assuring the interface could translate between display sizes without changing the interface too much was important. That in mind, we chose to make the site responsive, where components did not have to be redesigned or scaled poorly depending on your device’s size. Getting away from having users have to pinch-and-zoom was a goal of ours too.</p>
				<h3>Modular</h3>
				<p>We decided to use cards as the primary component of content organization for the portal. Cards could be used on the homepage to show overviews of each subpage and then when a user navigated to a subpage, they could continue to find parceled, organized information in a familiar format.</p>
				<h3>Scalable</h3>
				<p>We wanted to assure that if additional features and content were added to the tenant portal, the considerations of how to introduce these features would be easily understood. Since the completion of the initial tenant portal redesign, features that allow users to view previously e-signed leases purchase renters insurance, and view additional units were added without having to revisit design choices made during this initial work.</p>

		<p>After rounds of iterating, testing, and evaluating of mobile and desktop prototypes, the team was able to converge on a design we all felt met the needs of our customers and their tenants.</p>
		<p>We went from evaluating dashboard ideas through dot-voting set up in our office kitchen to more in-depth testing where users ran the gamut of all the functionality the portal had to offer.</p>
		<p>This was followed by a beta release of the portal to tenants who had not seen or used the portal before. This release strategy helped us understand whether conversion rates in our new flow would be comparable or better than conversions in our current flow. This strategy, similar to the testing-with-non-users strategy, helped us get a perspective that was not affected by previous use of the portal.</p>

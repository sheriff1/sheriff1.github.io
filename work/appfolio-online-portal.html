        <div>
            <p>The AppFolio Online Portal is where our customers' tenants and homeowners can log in to make payments and submit maintenance requests. AppFolio wanted to update their online portal to be modern and work well on mobile devices to attract more customers and more tenants and homeowner all-the-while, maintaining an experience that was generating consistent revenue for the company.</p>

        <h2 class="u-pad-ts">My Role</h2>
		<p>As the team's product designer, I was tasked to define a scalable design for our online portal. I led the research and design for the project's discovery and early delivery phases. I was an active part of strategizing delivery and prioritization of features.</p>

			<h2>Understanding current and future needs</h2>
			<p>Before addressing the opportunity as stated, our team wanted to assure we knew where the most value would be for our work. Redesigning the portal was a valid focus, but if there was more opportunity we could address in the midst, we wanted to be at least aware of it.</p>
			<h3 class="appfolio-feature-header">Customer Surveys</h3>
			<p>We did an initial inquiry with our customer base to learn more about more they wanted from the online portal from improvements to additional features.</p>
			<h3 class="appfolio-feature-header">Internal Assessment</h3>
			<p>We conducted stakeholder interviews to understand what others in the business thought could be improved in the online portal based on their experience with users of the portal and where they saw growth opportunities for our business that may involve the portal.</p>
			<h3 class="appfolio-feature-header">Synthesis</h3>
			<p>We brought both the customer and business feedback together to create a definitive list of what we understood everyone wanted from the portal. With this list, we could prioritize where to apply our efforts and inform future efforts to improve the portal that may require more research.</p>

<h2>Scalability & component design decisions</h3>
<p>Our opportunity was already well-defined, but what additionally arose beyond the initial brief was the focus on making the portal design scalable beyond its current set of features. Both customers and internal stakeholders mentioned features they may want to include in the portal in the future. This led us to the follow considerations for the portal design:
</p>

    <div class="row u-space-vm vcenter">
        <div class="col-lg-7 col-xl-7 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
            <h3 class="appfolio-feature-header">Responsive</h3>
            <p>Making the portal work well on mobile devices was a priority. At the time, users had to pinch-and-zoom if they were using the portal on a mobile device. We chose to make the site responsive, where components did not have to be redesigned or scaled poorly depending on your device’s size. This decision allowed us to focus on having to make design choices once that would work for all devices going into the future.</p>
            <h3 class="appfolio-feature-header">Modular</h3>
            <p>We decided to use cards as the primary content component for the portal. Cards could be used on the home page to show overviews of each subpage and then when a user navigated to a subpage, they could continue to find parceled, organized information in the same format.</p>
            <h3 class="appfolio-feature-header">Scalable</h3>
            <p>We wanted to assure that if additional features and content were added to the online portal, the considerations of how to introduce these features would be minimal, allowing teams to work smoother to evaluate their additions without the overhead of creating new components.</p>

<h2 class="u-space-bm">Designing for our customers’ customers</h2>
    <p>At AppFolio, we provide a product and services to property management professionals who then provide services to tenants and homeowners. Within what we provide customers, there are opportunities for AppFolio to have a direct effect on the tenant's experience and that's done through the AppFolio Online Portal.</p>
    <p>In understanding that, we had to make sure our design and implementation decisions aligned with user and customer goals. Getting access to our customers' customers began as a challenge. During our research, some customers let us know that they wanted to maintain the portal as a channel between their company and the tenant, and no one else.</p>

    <p class="u-pad-tm"> Even though some of our customers expressed this sentiment, others were OK with us testing with their tenants and homeowners. We also understood that anyone who fits the profile of a renter or homeowner could evaluate our design decisions so we conducted guerilla testing of our prototype as well as formal moderated and unmoderated testing on mobile and desktop devices with various people, some of which happened to use our portal or similar portals to make payments.</p>

    <h2 class="u-space-bm">From prototype to product</h2>
    <p>After rounds of iterating, testing, and evaluating of mobile and desktop prototypes, the team was able to converge on a design we all felt met the needs of our customers and their tenants and homeowners.</p>
    <p>We went from evaluating dashboard ideas through dot-voting set up in our office kitchen to more in-depth testing where users went through all of the functionality the portal had to offer.</p>

    <p>This was followed by a beta release of the portal to tenants and homeowners who had not seen or used the portal before. This release strategy helped us understand whether conversion rates in our new flow would be comparable or better than conversions in our current flow. This strategy, similar to the testing-with-non-users strategy, helped us get an additional dimension of perspective from users who hadn't interacted with our portal before.</p>

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p>Usage of the online portal overall stayed consistent as we continued to have more tenants and, homeowners use the portal. Since the update, mobile usage of the portal has increased and surpassed desktop usage.</p>

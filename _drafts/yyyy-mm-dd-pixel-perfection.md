My beef with pixel perfection is hopefully as simple as this:
When communicating design, if an aspect of a mockup does not translate 1-to-1 to the developed version, that does not mean we can compromise on the core design.

Picture this: you, interface designer extraordinaire, mock up a page with realistic content, recreated gradient-ed buttons with borders, and perfect CSS grid alignment. You lob the alley- to your development team who has been alongside you as you all have been building up this play together.

Then once development begins, the kerning doesn't match. And a sentence wraps to a new line.

Not only does your development team turn your artisanal lob into what to the audience will now look like a mis-timed pass, but it turns into a sloppy turnover.

The sloppy turnover being "well, since this sentence wraps to another line, I probably don't need to align the text the way it is in the rest of this mockup"... "And since I don't need to align the text, I probably don't need to center this button" ... "And since I don't need to center this button, I probably don't need to..."

and the saga continues until you're getting dunked on on the opposite side of the court.

"What happened!?" you ask yourself.

Your mockups were crisp, they follow patterns commonly seen in your application, the flow that the mockups represent has been evaluated. I did my part, and the squad was down... what's going on here...

A focus on pixel perfection is what's going on here.

Kerning in your favorite prototyping tool may not match exactly how Google Chrome has decided the kerning should look. That's life fam. Program-to-program, app-to-app, things don't always render exactly as you hope down to the miniscule-est of details. Don't let this cause you and your team to slide down the slippery slope.

Conversely, I hope this doesn't lead designers to want to achieve absolute pixel perfection. It's a waste of your time to have to make a pixel-perfect case across your entire design just to assure all other pixel-"alright" considerations of your design are taken serious.

Do field questions of compromise in your designs, but preempting the compromise can be a painful process. Conversely, showing flippancy at the first sign of inconsistency is not beneficial either. Communicate and compromise as needed. Avoid being design pedants. 

(Job posters; please remove qualifications reminiscent to "You're a fiend for pixel perfection" from your postings for designers.)

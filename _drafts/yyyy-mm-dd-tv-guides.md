Most people who have lived a mainstream suburban life have experience watching TV. Even the Gen-whatever-comes-after-millenials have a bit of TV experience amongst all the internet-based media they consume.

The personal experience with TV has changed over time, and with it changed the TV guide... the TV guide; the medium that let's you know what'll be on TV and when it'll be on TV.
My oldest brother used to guard the TV guide as the sacred living room document. Yeah yeah, the sunday paper, the comics, the coupons can come through and exit, but the TV guide, that was ceremonial. On the weekend, he'd peruse it to see what to anticipate in the coming week, often just to re-affirm that WWF programming would come on at the expected times, but other times coming across the fact that Mighty Ducks was actually going to be coming on TV.

Of course, as movies and TV shows became more of an on-demand pull environment, one didn't have to worry about when Mighty Ducks would come on TV next, they'd be able to watch it in an instant. They didn't have to watch the full episode of WWF's weekly programming, for the highlights would be summarized by a personality on Youtube the next morning in a tenth of the time. What's there to anticipate if you can get a majority of it instantly?

We stopped getting the Sunday paper at some point; no more comics, coupons, or TV guides to look at on a weekly basis. We didn't have to wait for the TV guide channel to scroll past and let us know either. That was the worst inversion of the "What's on TV experience" may I add; "Yo dawg, want to know what's going to be on TV for the next 90 minutes? I got you, just give me 5 minutes to show it to you... You don't need that paper magazine that you can index to get the information you want in 1 minute, oh nah, we got a whole channel to occupy you with."

You know, this is just a curmudgeonly piece; "Ah, how I miss the days of TV guides". What I keep in mind is that it's always replaced with something better. We don't automate jobs just to put someone out of a job; we automate it to have that person's time replaced with something better. Sometimes though, and I'll claim this with the one where I haven't found the replacement. There was something to the TV guide experience for me. It sprinkled a social 'sazon' in my home. It gave me and my brothers a guidance for anticipation of TV shows we may not even end up watching. It inherently made TV interesting. And now TV's dead. It's almost as if TV was artful back then. The whole system of it. The TV guide, the local channels, the cable channels, the commercials, the freshness of what was going on with TV shows, the timing, the luck of it all mixing so well in the 90s. 

Just to summarize the contrast:
- In the 90s, we used the TV guide to guide our TV watching experience. We used the TV guide to anticipate shows, events, and movies.
- In the 00s, the TV guide basically died. With it died a bit of that feeling of anticipation. TV recognized this and were like "you know what...we don't need to tell people everything that's coming on..."
- Nowadays, the TV guide channel is a media channel; it shows movies and TV shows. Content is so on-demand, that TV channels realize if it's not one of their 3 major pieces of content, there's little anticipation that needs to be designed. You're no longer wondering who the guest on TRL will be, so instead MTV can in fact just show episode-after-episode of Ridiculousness. Un-anticipated content tied to a lack of expectation.

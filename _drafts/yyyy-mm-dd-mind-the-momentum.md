In our lines of work, of us have fallen into the "work for work's sake" situation, where sunken costs become more of the driving force to complete a project than the original purpose of the project. Similarly, we'll continue using processes and practices because "that's the way we've done it in the past, and it has worked."

It sounds valid when you first hear it, especially considering the uncertainty that may come by changing what you're doing.

The opportunity cost of slowing down should be deliberately considered and taking a pause to do so is worth it. Sometimes we compromise and lose a bit of foresight for the sake of getting something done. Four additional weeks on a project with a sub-par output may be less valuable than taking a day or 2 to realize whether a change is needed and then following through with six additional weeks of work with a more purpose-driven version of your project.

How can you get to a point with your team to take this pause?

Make checking in early-and-often a basis of your team processes. Overall team health is important, and like with your personal health, taking time to self-assess even when things feel good, can be valuable in the long run. 

On a regular (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly) basis simply ask one another "Do we feel like we are still on the right track?" You can't guarantee that you are on the right track, since you're building it as you go, but it's worthwhile to look back and make sure (1) - you're still following the initial guidance for your project and (2) the initial guidance for your project is relevant. This can be applied to processes as well as projects.

For teams with projecs that are further down the line and don't have this practice in place, being tactful is important in what may be a difficult moment for your team. Questioning the momentum you may think needs to be reconsidered will surely affect your team and their work and some people may not even think anything about the project needs to be reconsidered. 

**Set the environment:** Optimistically, you want to be part of setting an environment at the outset of forming a team or starting a project, where everyone can be mindful of if the team is going in the right direction and is making good decisions. This is ideal, but can be challenging. It requires trust among team members to know that if any questions arise within the group, it is with relevance to their opinion and all team members' opinions should matter in a project.

**If the environment isn't set:** retrospect as a team, in smaller groups, or pairs. Most especially if you are in an environment where you have a managing superior or colleagues you can chat with about how you're feeling about the project.

**If the environment refuses to be set:** ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è -- I can't say I know exactly what to advise if this is the case. As the reader you may or may not be in a position where you feel comfortable or feel best-suited to address this issue with your team or teams. Noting the previous experiences that you've had though and making personal corrections to how you work to take the time to "mind the momentum" may be a good start though, and will hopefully be a contagious trait. (If you have had difficulties getting your team to "mind the momentum" and have overcome them, please let me know what you've done!)

With a project, there will always be a "trail of destruction"; used resources, time, effort, newly created things for your audience. Take a moment within the process to assess your "trail of destruction".

Are you leaving too many remnants that others will have to deal with?

Are the newly created things what the audience really wanted?

These are easier questions to answer as you go as opposed to asking all at the end. 

And even if these questions are asked and changes are made, no guarantee can be made that your venture into changing aspects about your project or process. With diligence though, you can guarantee that you and your ream have been deliberate in making decisions on how to go forward as opposed to resting on previous decision-making in what may be an ever-changing environment.

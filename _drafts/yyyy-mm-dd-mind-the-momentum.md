Picture this:
You kick off a project, semi-skeptical of how it will develop. As the project gets underway, you realize ideas are falling into place, your evaluating them with ease, you're starting to converge, and practically nothing's getting in your team's way of making progress.

Everyone's excited, including yourself.

The snowball keep rolling...

and getting larger...

nothing can get in its way...

but should it be that way?

Imagine the movie trope of the snowball rolling down the hill with nothing but momentum on its side, laying haste to anything in its way...

You rarely see the clean up scene.

Momentum can leave a trail of destruction. A trail that we rarely look back at. if we don't look back and try to figure things out, no matter the scale.

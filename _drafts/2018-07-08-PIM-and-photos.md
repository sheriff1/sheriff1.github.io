In graduate school I had this idea of what I wanted to do my dissertation research on.

The idea that my computer and other devices could know where I am and decide to prioritize the display applications and files based on where I am. “Oh, hey play boy, I see you’re on campus, let’s go ahead and show Blackboard and your textbooks in the bookmark bar instead of Youtube and ESPN.”

Surely not original, but still a need I felt carried value.

And five years later, I still have the same desire to work in this space since it hasn't seem to come to fruition in my use of technology, but many of the pieces are there: my phone knows when and even where I have taken this photo and my photo applications capitalize on this information by providing my date- and location-based albums. Rudimentary, but still valuable. I'd say though, that this use of context in my photos applications could go a step further.

“Why is this important?”
---------------------------
**So many photos:** Personal information management is only going to become more difficult the higher the volume of content you are storing for yourself becomes. Non-scientifically-speaking, in reviewing results from a brief survey about photo applications I sent out via Amazon Mechanical Turk, in response to "How many photos and videos do you have on your smartphone, tablet, computer, and/or in the cloud (please enter a number)", the average amount was about 3100 photos. I can only imagine what it may be like to filter, tag, and manage such a collection beyond simply the date the photo was taken and location in which the photo was taken.

**"What's this from again?":** It can be hard to make sense of what is important and what isn’t within one’s collections without the context of each item. A person could peruse through their photos and ask themselves "When was this important?", "where was I when I decided to save this photo?", and "Who else is relying on me having this photo?"

**"If I show you a picture on my phone...":** Several people have had the “don’t swipe left or right on my photos app” moment, where they want to show their friend or family member a photo without allowing access to any other photos; why not just be able to stow those away quickly, or have your photos app know that when you’re at work to just show photos taken at work, or maybe you can quickly tell your phone “Hey, I’d like to show Sandra pictures from the zoo yesterday” and wha-boom, only those photos show up for her to swipe through.

**Strengthening recall:** Without context, I can have a picture of a forest and not remember what year I took it, where I was when I took it, who I was with, and why I even took it in the first place. Without recall, your photos just pile up, and then when rummaging through the collection you find many erroneous pictures as well as tangent-catalyzing pictures (“Oh, I remember taking this picture, I meant to send that to Jacob…  I wonder what Jacob’s up to nowadays anyways…" -opens Facebook-…).

And all of these reasons for importance can span beyond photo collections, to video collections, notes, checklists, and emails.

“Surely this already exists…”
---------------------------
The simple answer is "Sure, probably", but it’s not the default, readily-available, nor does it seem openly easy to set up. Most consumers probably can't navigate Google's Awareness API, let alone should they.

In regards to two popular photo collection applications specifically: Apple Photos still requires me to tag my photos… you think I’m going to take the time to tag 1000+ photos? and Google Photos uses artificial intelligence to help me search for things like “fireworks”, but that may not be the sole context I need when I want to recall this photo. Especially in this exacting example, one probably doesn’t experience fireworks all too often, so searching semantically for “fireworks” may be just as easy as sorting by photos taken in July.

Google has an Awareness API developers can take advantage where applications can know information about seven dimensions of the user's location and activity.

“Ok, so what do you want Sheriff?”
---------------------------
I want my photos taken at work to file themselves in a more useful manner.

Don't make tagging my photos manually a chore. 

Tag some of them automatically. 

Don't have all my various sneaker screenshots mix in with my journey map photos. 

Put my sneaker screenshots in the "Ooo kill 'em" box where all my outfit inspiration lives and the journey maps in the "New customer onboarding meeting - 06/12/2018" box that's associated with my work cloud storage, so I don't have to clear storage on my damn iCloud account. 

Help me realize that I'll never use that photo of the nutrition facts on black beans I took back in 2010 again and prompt me to get rid of it and the 5 others (I was trackin' them macros, but now I'm not).

Help me group photos of my family and friends who are hundreds of miles away together for me to swipe through on an idle afternoon.

The idea of transient media (tweets, snapchats, statuses, etc.) is perfectly fine, but when the media format of video, audio, photo, and text can have multiple purposes, such as playing the role of reminiscent media (photos albums, home videos), we should have tools that facilitate the needs there just as much as we have tools that facilitate transient media. And not to be overly highfalutin, but you can imagine if folks had more avenues to spend more time in reminiscent media, we could engage more in being reflective and introspective.

I want people to have the opportunity to reclaim their digital collections and exercise balance of what their cameras do. A camera allows me to take photos; the various applications influence my reason to take photos.

In graduate school I had this idea of what I wanted to do my dissertation research on.

The idea that my computer and other devices could know where I am and decide to prioritize the display applications and files based on where I am. “Oh, hey play boy, I see you’re on campus, let’s go ahead and show Blackboard and your textbooks in the bookmark bar instead of Youtube and ESPN.”

Surely not original, but still an unmet need in the consumer world.

I really wanted to do this, but did not have the technical skill or patience to do so… so instead, I did tangential work in having a device divide a user’s calendar into their different “contexts” and visual them in different ways based on prioritization and if it is an upcoming event.

And five years later, I still have the same desire to work in this space since it hasn't pervaded my day-to-day life yet.

“Why is this important?”
---------------------------
**So many photos:** Personal information management is only going to become more difficult the higher the volume of content you are storing for yourself becomes. Non-scientifically-speaking, in reviewing results from a brief survey about photo applications I sent out via Amazon Mechanical Turk, in response to "How many photos and videos do you have on your smartphone, tablet, computer, and/or in the cloud (please enter a number)", the average amount was about 3100 photos. I can only imagine what it may be like to filter, tag, and manage such a collection.

**What's this from again?:** It can be hard to make sense of what is important and what isn’t, within one’s collections, without the context of each item (when was this important? where was I when I first decided to store this? who else is relying on me storing this? etc.)

**Hope mom doesn't see that...:** Several people have had those “don’t swipe right on my photos app” moment; why not just be able to stow those away quickly, or have your photos app know that when you’re at work to just show photos taken at work, or maybe you can quickly tell your phone “Hey, I’d like to show Sandra pictures from the zoo yesterday” and wha-boom, only those photos show up for her to swipe through

**Strengthening recall:** Without context, I can have a picture of a forest and not remember what year I took it, where I was when I took it, who I was with, and why I even took it in the first place. Without recall, your photos just pile up, and then when rummaging through the collection you find many erroneous pictures as well as tangent-catalyzing pictures (“Oh, I remember taking this picture, I meant to send that to Jacob…  I wonder what Jacob’s up to nowadays anyways…" -opens Facebook-…)

“Surely this already exists…”
---------------------------
The simple answer is "Sure, probably", but it’s not the default, readily-available, nor does it seem openly easy to set up.

In regards to two popular photo collection applications specifically: Apple Photos still requires me to tag my photos… you think I’m going to tag 1000+ photos? and Google Photos uses artificial intelligence to help me search for things like “fireworks”, but that may not be the sole context I need when I want to recall this photo. Especially in this exacting example, one probably doesn’t experience fireworks all too often, so searching semantically for “fireworks” may be just as easy as sorting by photos taken in July

 Google has an Awareness API developers can take advantage where applications can know information about seven dimensions of the user's location and activity.

“Ok, so what do you want?”
---------------------------
I want my photos taken at work to file themselves in the right place. Potentially even storing them on my higher-volume computer storage avenues, may that be in the cloud or on the computer itself

I want people to have the opportunity to reclaim their digital collections. The idea of transient media (tweets, snapchats, statuses, etc.) is perfectly fine, but when the media format of video, audio, photo, and text can have multiple purposes, such as playing the role of reminiscent media, we should have tools that facilitate the needs there just as much as we have tools that facilitate transient media. And not too get too highfalutin, but you can imagine if society had more avenues to spend more time in reminiscent media, we can engage more with slower thinking, hopefully stoking introspection and reflection in our society.

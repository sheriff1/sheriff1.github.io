I've often times found myself in a situation where I am conducting a usability test or interview with a user and they lead me to an idea. I follow up with a question that can be basically summarized as "What do you think of this improvement that just came to my mind?", which is normally responded to with the phrase, "Yeah, that would be great!"

My jollies are secured. The user has validated an idea I've put forth, amidst evaluating other ideas I've presented. All is well.

Well... kind of.

- when having your ideas evaluated, your brain is ideally looking for validation that you've gone down the right path.

- when validating an idea with a user, be sure to take the consideration that they may not be in the most realistic context to evaluate your idea.

- try to be discrete when assessing multivariate experiences. If a user expresses a sentiment towards a a high-level aspect of your designs, make an effort to pinpoint the mapping of sentiment to feature.

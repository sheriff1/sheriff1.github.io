- You'll see someone with an extensive book collection, but it is storied that those books are not all read.
	- "They never tell you when you buy the book that you have to buy the time to read the book..." - Paul's friend Roy
	- Ties into reminiscent and transient media and the patience to connect to the media
	- So then what do you with personal collections of books?

- The story of a true personal librarian
	- Libib - a coworker of mine (Paul T.) uses an application to manage his personal book collection. This extends the ability to manage his collection and the additional traits of having a collection; sharing it, lending it out, revising it, updating it, making sure to avoid duplicates (especially in shared personal collections -- Paul shares his book collection with his wife; ever a work-in-progress just as the relationship itself is).

============================================ OTHER PIM NOTES ============================================
=========================================================================================================
Blog post on PIM & context aware operating system:

- “In graduate school, I had this idea…”
    - The idea that my computer and other devices could know where I am and decide to prioritize the display applications and files based on where I am. “Oh, hey play boy, I see you’re on campus, let’s go ahead and show Blackboard and your textbooks in the bookmark bar instead of Youtube and ESPN.”
    - I really wanted to do this, but had no technical skill to do this… so instead, I did tangential work in having a device divide a user’s calendar into their different “contexts” and visual them in different ways based on prioritization and if it is an upcoming event.
    - The lack of my technical skills haven’t quelled the issue though… 

- “I conducted a survey asking…”
    - asking people how many photos and videos they think they have on their phone and in the cloud
    - asking them if they take photos at home, work, social gatherings, public locations, etc.
    - asking them how they organize their photos, if at all

- “Why is this important?”
    - personal information management is only going to become more difficult the higher the volume of content you are storing for yourself becomes
    - It can be hard to make sense of what is important and what isn’t, within one’s collections, without the context of each item (when was this important? where was I when I first decided to store this? who else is relying on me storing this? etc.)
    - Several people have had those “don’t swipe right on my photos app” moment; why not just be able to stow those away quickly, or have your photos app know that when you’re at work to just show photos taken at work, or maybe you can quickly tell your phone “Hey, I’d like to show Sandra pictures from the zoo yesterday” and wha-boom, only those photos show up for her to swipe through
    - strengthens recall: w/o context, I can have a picture of a forest and not remember what year I took it, where I was when I took it, who I was with, and why I even took it in the first place.
            - Without recall, your photos just pile up, and then when rummaging through the collection you find many erroneous pictures as well as tangent-catalyzing pictures (“Oh, I remember taking this picture, I meant to send that to Jacob…  I wonder what Jacob’s up to nowadays anyways… -opens Facebook-…)

- “Surely this already exists…”
    - Maybe, but it’s not the default, nor does it seem openly easy to set up.
    - Apple Photos still requires me to tag my photos… you think I’m going to tag 1000+ photos?
    - Google Photos uses artificial intelligence to help me search for things like “fireworks”, but that may not be the sole context I need when I want to recall this photo. Especially in this exacting example, one probably doesn’t experience fireworks all too often, so searching semantically for “fireworks” may be just as easy as sorting by photos taken in July

- “Ok, so what do you want?”
    - I want my photos taken at work to file themselves in the right place. Potentially even storing them on my higher-volume computer storage avenues, may that be in the cloud or on the computer itself
    - I want to reclaim my digital collections. The idea of transient media (tweets, snapchats, statuses, etc.) is perfectly fine, but when the media format can have multiple purposes, such as playing the role of reminiscent media, we should have tools that facilitate the needs there just as much as we have tools that facilitate transient media. And not too get too highfalutin, but you can imagine if society had more avenues to spend more time with their reminiscent media, we can engage more with slower, deeper thinking. A slippery slope I’d gladly slide down.

So I’ll be embarking on design such a thing. PLZ HALP.

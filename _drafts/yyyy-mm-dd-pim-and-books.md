- You'll see someone with an extensive book collection, but it is storied that those books are not all read.
	- "They never tell you when you buy the book that you have to buy the time to read the book..." - Paul's friend Roy
	- Ties into reminiscent and transient media and the patience to connect to the media

This extends the ability to manage his collection and the additional traits of having a collection; sharing it, lending it out, revising it, updating it, making sure to avoid duplicates (especially in shared personal collections -- Paul shares his book collection with his wife; ever a work-in-progress just as the relationship itself is).

## Does your job pay you to get better at your job?

It's an interesting question. I assume most do not have the luxury of "professional development" programs or budgets, but that is normally the way a company will tout being able to answer "Yes" to that question.

I have been fortunate enough to attend workshops and trainings, and hear talks about different product & service design techniques and practices. This paired with reading a lot of books & blog posts has put me in a place where I feel very well-educated in my space of work.

Earlier in my working days, I would consume the content & be excited about bringing that knowledge back to my colleagues. I eventually found myself in a pattern of learning interesting processes and techniques, but not ever experimenting with them though.

Of course some of that is in my own hands; I can work harder in evangelize new things our teams can do and even do proof of concept work on the side that showcases the value of the new idea I learned about. This can be challenging though as everyone may know, especially in fast-moving work environments that are output-driven.

## Professional development options are mostly educational. Team members need opportunities to exercise their professional development.

It can be challenging to carve out time ane resources for team members to exercise professional development, but knowing you are investing in trainings should beget the subsequent investment of getting team members to utilize what they learn.

### Experimenting amidst deadlines
Work is mostly deadline-driven by default. With deadlines, there can be limited room to experiment with new methods of doing work.

Experimentation with new methods may be welcomed though, but there are risks there such as more time than expected being taken, debt being introduced, and a lack of contingency for maintaining experimental outputs (I know I still have a flash message on some screen in our app that don't match the others...ü§´).

### Repeat work opportunities
Another challenge to exercising professional development is the lack of opportunity to do the same type of work to iterate on the methods being tried. Team members may only apply one practice once or twice, especially if there are gaps in time between being able to apply the technique again. That makes the method high stakes and team members may feel like they need to do what they're trying for the first time perfectly.

Most work presents repeat work opportunities though, that are similar enough that one can experiment with methods all-the-while bouncing between different projects. 
Doing something and tinkering with the process based on what they learn is what can help a team member apply their professional development. 

This is good for techniques one can use in their individual work: a Sketch shortcut, a new Javscript framework, but there are often techniques that extend beyond what is solely in our individual work flows.

### Resourcing
That said, resourcing can be a blocker in true professional development as well, especially for more junior team members. There are methods that require knowledge and expertise outside of our individual skillset, that may require a range of collaborators to be part of the process of evaluating the new method.

If can be tough to get them onboard and the path to evangelizing can be onerous amidst all the other tasks the workplace requires.

### All that considered...
It still seems that there is room to optimize exercise what is learned through professional development. The workplace is in need of providing opportunity to exercise newly-learned skills, techniques, and practices. I think we need practice.

## The value of workplace practice

### Solid construction of expertise
Imagine if Serena Williams did not have practice within her profession. Repetition of common practices and experimentation with new techniques to improve her on-court performance is likely a key part of her getting prepared for tennis tournaments and all of those are happening outside of competition.

### Flow
Athletes who practice and tinker with new techniques can also find themselves in flow states, where the game is going slower and can identify the finest details of their performance to make quick changes. 

As I type this, I remember when [LeBron James hit that running off-balance floater to win the game in the Eastern Conference Finals in 2018](https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2018/5/6/17324448/lebron-james-game-winning-floater-sportscenter-top-10) (If you don't care for the LeBron anecdote, just replace it with Steph Curry and his half-court pull-up jumpers, or whatever). He was in flow. Even if this wasn't a shot he explicitly practiced, he's had so many opportunities to tinker with his skillset outside of the actual game and have the confidence to take and make this shot.

These clear benefits of practice in sports can surely be applied to other domains. It is not a concept we're unfamiliar with either, with the whole homework thing from our schooling days and all...

## Where's our practice?
It can be challenging in the workplace to find opportunities to "practice", or be enabled to exercise new things you've learned. Of course, you can use free time to work on side projects as well as venture out on your own to enable yourself professionally, but it seems like the workplace model is in need of an explicit shift to incorporate professional enablement in work alongside professional development programs like trainings and seminars.

Professional enablement is an investment in teams. Incorporating professional enablement in the workplace requires "slowing down" output to assure output quality is progressive. Much of the process of being creative and producing something new should be experimentation. 

Companies provide hack days, 10% time, and other activities that allow team members to work on something outside of the scope of their current work. This is fine and well, but what if Serena or LeBron only tried new things to develop their game 1 day every other week?

## Professional enablement is our practice.
Most opportunity is created without systems in place to do so at work. People often give the advice of "go out and prove the importance of what you want to do!", that "visionary" advice of enabling yourself to do work. This can feel a bit "toe-steppy" for those who are a bit earlier on in their career, but want to develop their careers. 

Making space for the opportunities for team members to do this, especially for more junior team members.

Make it easier for your team members to go get it with some professional enablement.

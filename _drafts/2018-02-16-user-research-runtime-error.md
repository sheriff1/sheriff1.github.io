User Research Runtime Error: Basically you can't truly evaluate something until someone uses it
	- the "better" result of this is that users complain directly to you via feedback or customer support
	- the worse result of this runtime error is when they do not tell you that it was irritating/not useful for them to use

- This idea extends to product development as a whole already, but is slightly easier to overcome. You can assume a person will become a customer of your product based on an MVP you have put together, and if your MVP is end-to-end (like it should be), then you have enough to avoid the runtime error of if your product is going to get off the ground.

Almost every morning during the work week, I open the iHeartRadio app on my phone. I listen to a quirky radio show from back in my hometown.  Almost every morning when I open the app, al pop up advertisement like this pops up:

It pops up like a shade of a second after the app has opened. As most apps go, you usually press a button in the app to initiate whatever you’re trying to do: a play button in the music player, the “start” button for a game: there are patterns you eventually adapt to, and you get into the rote motion of where to press. You can do it without looking.

And you know what iHeartRadio decided to do? Take advantage of my clickety thumbs!

That advertisement that pops up is a full-screen button. 

That full-screen button immediately leads me to this:

Now, this may be an absolute coincidence (but I doubt it), but I’ve developed another rote behavior when using the iHeartRadio app. There’s a 30-second ad that usually plays before it jumps into the radio station playing, and when I click that ad, it opens my browser on my phone. The whole "skip ad-but it opens your browser" is a common thing I’ve seen with other apps, so the rote behavior is reinforced to quickly double-click my home button to close my browser and jump back into the app.

Now with this, my thumb is on the home button of my iPhone 7.

and with that, what iHeartRadio does next is wack.

The subscription thumbprint verification pops up just as my thumb jumps to do the double-click out of Safari and they try their best to pilfer $15/month from my pockets (insert pocket-tapping GIF here).

iHeartRadio: C’mon fam.

You know what you’re doing. I’m sure you are not a sole culprit, but it’s not a pattern of my most highly-coveted applications…or any legitimate application.

It’s the radio. What you want me to pay for, you can do a better job of educating me on. Give me the value proposition and help me get a sense of why I should spend $15 on this instead of sneakily trying to get me to subscribe and then have me say “oh phooey, I don’t know how to unsubscribe. Guess I’m spending this $15 a month…”

Like look at this advertisement:

It doesn’t tell me the value of what I’m getting in to, but it wants me to make a choice immediately after interacting with it. 

Imagine going into an apparel store, picking up a shirt and then the cashier rolling up on you, barcode scanner in-hand, scanning the shirt’s barcode and then telling you how much you owe. 

**Cashier:** “That’ll be 44.99. Credit or debit?”

**Me:** “EXCUSE ME, PERSON, I JUST GOT HERE. I DON’T KNOW IF I WANT THIS. (looks at shirt). THIS SHIRT AIN’T E’EN MY SIZE? WHATCHU MEAN?”

iHeartRadio: C’mon fam.

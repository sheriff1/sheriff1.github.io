This is a placeholder for the goals of my blog

- To review things that make me feel good
- I'm going to at some point try to get into cartoon-styled illustration and blog about my progress
- I'm going to at some point try to either create or be part of the creation of audio or audiovisual content and blog about that process
- Make up an ambiguous magazine cover with my picture on it. Imagine a magazine called "Eh?" or somethin'.

I hope this list eventually turns into a list of links to the goals themselves.

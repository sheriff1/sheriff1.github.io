This is a placeholder for the goals of my blog

- To review things that make me feel good
- To randomly make lists of things and come back to them later, recursively
- I'm going to at some point try to get into cartoon-styled illustration and blog about my progress
- I'm going to at some point try to either create or be part of the creation of audio or audiovisual content and blog about that process
- Make up an ambiguous magazine cover with my picture on it

Characteristics of this blog
- I'll be wrong a lot.
- Some things will be finely edited, others will be quite rough, and content will be tagged within the spectrum of finely edited and quite rough.

I hope this list turns into a list of links to all of the goals.

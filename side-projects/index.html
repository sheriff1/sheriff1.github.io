			<p>At the time I started Fitbuilder++, I had been working out pretty consistently for four straight years, but I could not define "pretty consistently" to myself with a number. There were also ebbs and flows in my workout life cycle where I may be in the gym 4-5 days a week and then the next month be in the gym 0-1 days a week. I did not know what caused these ebbs and flows or when they happened over the course of the time I have been working out, but I had been recording my workouts using an app called FitBuilder basically ever since I started. FitBuilder had a huge amount of my workout information: days I worked out, duration of my workout, what type of exercises I did that day, reps, sets, weight, and I could only peruse and comprehend that information through FitBuilder's interface. Luckily they had an export, which allowed me to create graphs and charts to start making sense of the data and drew more questions out of me that I wanted answers to.</p>

(It also helped me look into my past patterns and think deeper about why my workout behavior was what it was during specific time periods, for example I ran a lot for 3 months in college, but did not run much afterwards...why? -- because I took a running class of course, I just hadn't recalled recording that in the app...or running 3 miles every Tuesday & Thursday in the Fall of 2015)</p>

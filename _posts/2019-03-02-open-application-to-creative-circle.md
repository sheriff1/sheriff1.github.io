## This is my unsolicited application to join/create a creative circle.

The past few years of my life, I've been stacking that cheese, but I've lacked building my community & networking.

Even when I make an effort, I feel like I'm doing too much even to send a message saying "Hey, long-time" cuz I get in my head about the caveats to not getting a response.

With that said, in this moment of vulnerability: This is my unsolicited application to join/create a creative circle. 

What do I bring to the table? What'll the circle be like? Well, at the very least:

I’m more of a “why” person than a “yes” person. That said, I'll gas you up when you should be gassed and be constructive when it would be suitable.

I can provide web and software design assistance.

I'll buy your product at full-price, volunteer at your events, advertise them, all that.

I wanna talk about purpose, who you are, and how you’ve have become who you are. What happens in the middle and behind-the-scenes is just as important as the output. I want to support on all that too.

I want to check on you: strong friend, weak friend, anywhere-in-between friend, I want to make sure we keep up with each other and advise each other mentally, emotionally, and physically to whatever degree we feel comfortable.

I want us to give back to the people.

I want us to build meaningful things and ideas together.

I want us to push the bounds of our abilities, improve, and become better at what we do. Let's make a brand, merch, open a beef patty cart, whatever we want; let's be open to giving it a try and see where it takes us. I know my mom's Jollof recipe by heart, so we can start there.

I want to goof around & celebrate together. Work hard, play hard, all dat. Even basic stuff; hit me up when you don't have anyone else to go to that movie with.

I will admit when I don’t know what’s going on or what something means.

I close conversations by saying “peace”, so you know 50% of my general temperament from that.

Let’s be great together. 

(I'm going to start doing some of this stuff organically too, so if you realize it's happening, just know you're being initiated.)

Join the coalition (or let me join yours).
